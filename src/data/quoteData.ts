    quote: "One of the most ironic paradoxes of our time is this great availability of leisure that somehow fails to be translated into enjoyment. Compared to people living only a few generations ago, we have enormously greater opportunities to have a good time, yet there is no indication that we actually enjoy life more than our ancestors did. Opportunities alone, however, are not enough. We also need the skills to make use of them. And we need to know how to control consciousness—a skill that most people have not learned to cultivate. Surrounded by an astounding panoply of recreational gadgets and leisure choices, most of us go on being bored and vaguely frustrated.",

Hope, not possession, is that which gives tone and colour to his life.",

      quote: "We should not make the mistake of thinking the difference between the Creator and the creature is simply a difference in size. To do so is to assume God can be measured, as if he were merely a bigger version of ourselves. I call this the superhero syndrome. Christians like to think of God as their superhero, like us but with superpowers. But that is a terribly unbiblical portrayal of God’s infinite nature. He is not a God who simply possesses our powers but in endless measure. No, an infinite God transcends our characteristics altogether.",
