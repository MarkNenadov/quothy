    quote: "One of the most ironic paradoxes of our time is this great availability of leisure that somehow fails to be translated into enjoyment. Compared to people living only a few generations ago, we have enormously greater opportunities to have a good time, yet there is no indication that we actually enjoy life more than our ancestors did. Opportunities alone, however, are not enough. We also need the skills to make use of them. And we need to know how to control consciousness—a skill that most people have not learned to cultivate. Surrounded by an astounding panoply of recreational gadgets and leisure choices, most of us go on being bored and vaguely frustrated.",

At the highest levels, all of this cultural alignment comes to play in everything you do, because you spend so much of your time in the land of negotiation, collaboration, and cross-functional teamwork. This doesn’t mean that you can’t be successful in a company that holds some different values from your own. In fact, it’s pretty rare that you agree perfectly with every value of every person on the senior team of a company. You probably don’t even agree with every value of every person in your family, or among your friends! Still, the amount of overlap between the traits you value most and the traits your company values most largely determines how easy the fit will be for you.",

Don’t settle for a casual relationship that soothes your conscience; engage Christ’s discipleship call like you really believe the Son of God is the one who told you to do it. This is a concept with a rich biblical pedigree. In 2 Timothy 2:2 there are actually five distinct parties involved in mentorship. There is the core mentor/mentee rela-tionship of Paul and Timothy. This is happening in the context of 'many witnesses,' a reference to the local church. Furthermore, Paul charges Timothy to take up the dis-cipleship baton and entrust it to 'faithful men.' But even then the discipleship chain reaction isn’t finished: those faithful men are to be poured into so that they 'will be able to teach others also.' Paul’s vision for pastoral training is multigenerational mentorship in the context of the local church.",

The problem here, however, is the God's Word is not always massaged throughout the life of the congregation, like yeast through dought. People show up on Sunday for the sermon, and often do little more. The ministry of the Word stops at noon...the 'ministry of the Word' indeed begins in the pulpit, but then it must continue through the life of the church as members echo God's Word back and forth to one another. The word reverberates as in an echo chamber",
